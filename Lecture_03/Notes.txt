 **history of programming**, tracing its evolution from **machine code** through **assembly language**, to **procedural programming**, and finally to **object-oriented programming (OOP)**:

---

## 1. Machine Code (1940s - 1950s)

### What is Machine Code?

* **Machine code** is the most basic programming language.
* It consists of **binary instructions** (0s and 1s) directly understood by a computer's CPU.
* Each instruction corresponds to a very specific operation, like moving data, arithmetic operations, or jumps.

### Characteristics:

* **Low-level:** Closest to hardware.
* **Difficult to write and debug:** Humans find it very hard to read and write binary instructions.
* **Machine-specific:** Code written for one CPU architecture won’t work on another without rewriting.
* **Examples:** Early computers like ENIAC were programmed using machine code.

### Historical Context:

* Early computers had no high-level programming languages.
* Programmers had to manually input binary instructions or toggle switches.
* Program instructions were stored on punched cards or paper tape.

### Limitations:

* Tedious and error-prone.
* Lack of abstraction made development slow.

---

## 2. Assembly Language (Late 1940s - Present)

### What is Assembly Language?

* A thin abstraction over machine code.
* Uses **mnemonics** (human-readable codes) instead of raw binary, e.g., `MOV`, `ADD`, `JMP`.
* Still closely tied to the hardware architecture.

### Characteristics:

* Each assembly instruction corresponds to one machine instruction.
* Requires an **assembler** program to translate to machine code.
* Allows symbolic names for memory locations (labels) and constants.

### Historical Context:

* Developed to simplify programming at the machine level.
* Made code more readable, writable, and maintainable than raw machine code.
* Used heavily for systems programming (e.g., OS kernels, device drivers) where fine control over hardware is necessary.

### Limitations:

* Still complex and time-consuming for large applications.
* Still hardware-specific.
* Programmer must manage low-level details like registers and memory addresses.

---

## 3. Procedural Programming (1950s - Present)

### What is Procedural Programming?

* A programming paradigm based on the concept of **procedure calls** (functions or routines).
* Programs are divided into reusable blocks of code (procedures or functions).
* Focus on **step-by-step instructions** to perform tasks.

### Characteristics:

* Introduced **control structures** like loops (`for`, `while`), conditionals (`if`, `switch`).
* Supports variables, data structures, and modularity.
* Separation of data and functions — data is passive and manipulated by functions.
* Promotes code reuse and structured programming principles.

### Historical Context:

* Emerged with early high-level languages like **Fortran (1957)**, **ALGOL (1958)**, **COBOL (1959)**, **C (1972)**.
* Allowed programmers to write code that was portable and easier to understand.
* Led to significant productivity improvements in software development.

### Advantages:

* Higher level of abstraction than assembly.
* Easier to debug, maintain, and scale.
* Supported by many powerful compilers.

### Limitations:

* Programs can become complex as size grows.
* Poor at modeling real-world entities because data and procedures are separate.
* Can lead to **spaghetti code** if not properly structured.

---

## 4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1960s - Present)

### What is Object-Oriented Programming?

* A paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which encapsulate **data** and **behavior**.
* Objects are instances of **classes**, which define attributes (data fields) and methods (functions).
* Focuses on **modeling real-world entities** and interactions.

### Core Concepts:

* **Encapsulation:** Data and methods are bundled together.
* **Inheritance:** Classes can inherit properties and methods from other classes.
* **Polymorphism:** Objects can be treated as instances of their parent class, allowing flexible interfaces.
* **Abstraction:** Hiding internal complexity, exposing only necessary parts.

### Historical Context:

* Early concepts appeared in the 1960s with languages like **Simula (1967)**.
* Popularized by **Smalltalk (1970s)**.
* Became mainstream with languages like **C++ (1983)**, **Java (1995)**, **Python**, **C#**, etc.

### Advantages:

* Models complex systems more naturally.
* Encourages code reuse through inheritance and polymorphism.
* Improves maintainability and scalability.
* Supports large-scale software engineering.

### How it differs from Procedural:

* Procedural: Code is organized around functions.
* OOP: Code is organized around objects combining data and behavior.
* OOP makes it easier to manage growing complexity by aligning code structure with problem domains.

## Why This Evolution Happened

* **Increasing complexity:** Software systems became larger and more complex.
* **Need for abstraction:** To reduce human error and improve productivity.
* **Hardware advancements:** Allowed higher-level languages to be compiled efficiently.
* **Software reuse and maintenance:** OOP supports code reuse and modular maintenance.
* **Closer modeling of real-world problems:** OOP allows direct mapping between code and real-world entities.

---


// OOPS in Depth -->
---

### 1. **Class**

* A **class** is like a **blueprint** or **template** for creating objects.
* It defines **what attributes (data)** and **what behaviors (methods)** the objects created from this blueprint will have.
* Think of a class as a *concept* or *category*.

**Example:**
If you have a class called `Car`, it might specify that every car has attributes like `color`, `model`, and `speed`, and behaviors like `start()`, `accelerate()`, and `stop()`.

---

### 2. **Object**

* An **object** is an **instance** of a class.
* It represents a **concrete entity** created using the class blueprint.
* Each object has actual values for the attributes defined in its class.

**Example:**
If `Car` is a class, then your own red Toyota Corolla is an **object** of that class. Another object might be a blue Ford Mustang.

---

### 3. **Attributes (also called Properties or Fields)**

* These are the **data members** or **variables** inside a class.
* Attributes represent the **state or characteristics** of an object.
* They hold information about the object.

**Example:**
For a `Car` object, attributes could be:

* `color = "red"`
* `model = "Toyota Corolla"`
* `speed = 0`

These describe the **state** of that specific car.

---

### 4. **Method**

* A **method** is a **function** defined inside a class.
* It represents **behavior or actions** that the objects of the class can perform.
* Methods can use or modify the attributes of the object.

**Example:**
For the `Car` class, methods might be:

* `start()`: to start the engine
* `accelerate()`: to increase the speed
* `stop()`: to stop the car

When you call these methods on a `Car` object, the object performs those actions.

---

## Putting it all together — a simple analogy:

| Concept        | Analogy                 | Explanation                                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Class**      | Recipe for a cake       | Defines the ingredients and steps                         |
| **Object**     | A specific cake made    | A cake baked using the recipe with actual flavor and size |
| **Attributes** | Ingredients of the cake | Flour, sugar, eggs (state of the cake)                    |
| **Methods**    | Actions in the recipe   | Mix, bake, frost (behaviors/actions on the cake)          |

---

### Code Example in Java

```java
class Car {
    // Attributes (state)
    String color;
    String model;
    int speed;

    // Constructor to create a Car object with initial values
    Car(String color, String model) {
        this.color = color;
        this.model = model;
        this.speed = 0; // default speed
    }

    // Method (behavior)
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car started");
    }

    void accelerate(int increment) {
        speed += increment;
        System.out.println("Accelerating. Speed: " + speed);
    }

    void stop() {
        speed = 0;
        System.out.println("Car stopped");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Red", "Toyota Corolla"); // Object created from class
        myCar.start();       // Method call
        myCar.accelerate(50);
        myCar.stop();
    }
}
```

// 4 Pillars of OOPS -->

---

## 1. **Encapsulation**

### What is Encapsulation?

* Encapsulation is the concept of **bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class**.
* It also involves **restricting direct access to some of an object's components**, which means internal object details are hidden from the outside world.
* This is often called **data hiding**.

### Why is Encapsulation Important?

* It **protects the internal state** of an object from unintended or harmful modifications.
* The object's data can only be accessed or changed through well-defined **interfaces (methods)**.
* Makes code easier to maintain and reduces complexity by **separating the object's internal workings from the outside**.
* Enhances **security** and **modularity**.

### Example in Concept

Imagine a bank account object:

* The balance is private and cannot be directly accessed or changed.
* To deposit or withdraw money, you must use the provided methods (`deposit()`, `withdraw()`).
* This prevents invalid operations, like directly setting the balance to a negative number.

---

## 2. **Inheritance**

### What is Inheritance?

* Inheritance allows a new class (called **child or subclass**) to **derive properties and behaviors from an existing class** (called **parent or superclass**).
* The child class **inherits** the attributes and methods of the parent but can also have its own unique features.
* It establishes an **“is-a”** relationship.

### Why is Inheritance Important?

* Promotes **code reuse** — common code can be written once in a parent class and shared by multiple subclasses.
* Enables **hierarchical classifications** of concepts, reflecting real-world relationships.
* Allows **extending or modifying behavior** without changing existing code (supporting the Open/Closed principle).

### Example in Concept

Consider a `Vehicle` class:

* `Car` and `Bike` classes can inherit from `Vehicle`.
* `Vehicle` has attributes like speed, fuel; `Car` and `Bike` can reuse those and add their own specifics.

---

## 3. **Polymorphism**

### What is Polymorphism?

* Polymorphism means **“many forms”**.
* It allows objects of different classes related by inheritance to be **treated as objects of a common superclass**.
* The **same operation or method can behave differently on different classes**.
* Two main types:

  * **Compile-time polymorphism** (method overloading)
  * **Run-time polymorphism** (method overriding)

### Why is Polymorphism Important?

* Enables **flexible and extensible code**.
* You can write code that works on the superclass type, but the actual method that runs depends on the subclass.
* Facilitates **dynamic method dispatch**, allowing systems to be more easily extended.

### Example in Concept

Imagine a function that calls a `draw()` method on different `Shape` objects:

* A `Circle` object’s `draw()` will draw a circle.
* A `Rectangle` object’s `draw()` will draw a rectangle.
* The caller just calls `draw()`, and the right method executes depending on the actual shape.

---

## 4. **Abstraction**

### What is Abstraction?

* Abstraction is about **hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features** to the user.
* It focuses on **what an object does rather than how it does it**.
* It helps reduce complexity by providing a simplified interface.

### Why is Abstraction Important?

* Helps programmers think about problems at a high level without worrying about inner details.
* Enables changes in implementation without affecting users of the abstraction.
* Supports **modular programming**, where you can change or improve parts independently.

### Example in Concept

Think about using a car:

* You know how to drive it using the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift (interface).
* You don’t need to know how the engine works internally (implementation).
* The car hides its complex mechanics behind a simple interface.

# Summary Table of the 4 Pillars

| Pillar            | What It Means                               | Why Important                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Encapsulation** | Bundling data and methods; hiding internals | Protects object state; simplifies use            |
| **Inheritance**   | Deriving new classes from existing ones     | Enables code reuse; models hierarchy             |
| **Polymorphism**  | Same interface, different behaviors         | Enables flexibility and extensibility            |
| **Abstraction**   | Showing only essential features             | Reduces complexity; hides implementation details |

---

These four pillars work together to make OOP a powerful paradigm for building flexible, reusable, and maintainable software systems.



What is Access Modifier?


Sure! Let’s dive **deep into Access Modifiers in Java OOP** (Object-Oriented Programming).

---

# What are Access Modifiers in Java?

**Access Modifiers** are keywords in Java that **set the accessibility (visibility) level of classes, methods, variables, and constructors**. They control **where these members can be accessed from** within your program, helping with **encapsulation** — one of the core OOP principles.

---

# Why do we need Access Modifiers?

* To **restrict direct access** to some parts of your code (like sensitive data or internal methods).
* To **protect the integrity** of the data by hiding implementation details.
* To **control how other classes interact** with your class members.
* To **promote modular, maintainable, and secure code**.

---

# Types of Access Modifiers in Java

Java has **four main access modifiers**:

| Modifier                  | Where Accessible?                                                           | Level of Access                    |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **public**                | Anywhere in the project (any class, package, or module)                     | Most accessible                    |
| **protected**             | Within the same package, and also in subclasses (even if in other packages) | Medium-high access                 |
| **default** (no modifier) | Only within the same package                                                | Package-private                    |
| **private**               | Only within the same class                                                  | Least accessible (most restricted) |

---

### 1. `public`

* Members declared `public` can be accessed **from anywhere**.
* This includes any class in any package.
* Useful for API methods or constants you want to expose.

Example:

```java
public class Car {
    public String model;  // accessible everywhere
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car started");
    }
}
```

---

### 2. `protected`

* Accessible within:

  * The **same package** (like default)
  * **Subclasses** even if they are in different packages (inheritance access)
* Allows controlled access to subclasses, which is useful for extending classes.

Example:

```java
package vehicles;

public class Car {
    protected int speed;  // accessible to subclasses and package
}
```

And in another package:

```java
package sports;

import vehicles.Car;

public class SportsCar extends Car {
    public void boost() {
        speed += 50; // Allowed because speed is protected and SportsCar extends Car
    }
}
```

---

### 3. Default (Package-Private)

* If you **don’t specify any modifier**, Java applies **default access**.
* Members are accessible **only within the same package**.
* Useful to keep classes/members hidden from outside packages but accessible to related classes in the same package.

Example:

```java
class Bike {  // class is package-private
    void ride() {
        System.out.println("Bike riding");
    }
}
```

Outside the package, `Bike` class and its members are **not visible**.

---

### 4. `private`

* Members are accessible **only within the class** they are declared in.
* Helps in hiding implementation details and ensuring encapsulation.
* Private members **cannot be accessed** by subclasses or any other classes.

Example:

```java
public class Account {
    private double balance;  // cannot be accessed outside Account class
    
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }
    
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

---

# Accessibility Summary (for class members):

| Modifier    | Same Class | Same Package | Subclass (same package) | Subclass (different package) | Anywhere |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------- |
| `public`    | Yes        | Yes          | Yes                     | Yes                          | Yes      |
| `protected` | Yes        | Yes          | Yes                     | Yes                          | No       |
| Default     | Yes        | Yes          | Yes                     | No                           | No       |
| `private`   | Yes        | No           | No                      | No                           | No       |

---

# Notes on Access Modifiers

* **Classes** can be `public` or **default (package-private)** only. You cannot declare a top-level class as `private` or `protected`.
* For **nested classes (inner classes)**, `private` and `protected` are allowed.
* Access modifiers are important in **designing APIs and libraries** to control how your classes are used.
* You can **combine access modifiers with other keywords** like `final`, `static`, and `abstract`.

---

# Real-life analogy of access modifiers:

* `public`: Your front door is open to everyone.
* `protected`: Only family and close relatives can enter.
* Default: Only neighbors in the same building can enter.
* `private`: Only you have the key; no one else is allowed.

---

# Summary

| Modifier    | Purpose                              | Example Use Case                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `public`    | Expose methods/data globally         | Library API methods, constants              |
| `protected` | Allow access to subclasses & package | Base class methods meant for overriding     |
| default     | Restrict access to package           | Helper classes and methods inside a package |
| `private`   | Hide details, encapsulate data       | Internal variables, helper methods          |
